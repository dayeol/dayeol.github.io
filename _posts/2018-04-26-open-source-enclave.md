title: "Keystone: An Open-Source Secure Enclave on the RISC-V Architecture"
---

# What I am doing?

I'm building an open-source platform for [trusted execution
environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment)
(TEE), based on [RISC-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V) infrastructure.
Secure hardware enclave provides strong integrity and confidentiality guarantee 
so that the remote users can securely execute their applications in the cloud.
However, no full-stack implementation of hardware enclave has been open-sourced 
until today. The goal of this project is to make TEE accessible to everyone in the industry
and the academia in order to build an open standard for secure enclave design,
which is applicable to a wide range of threat models.
