# What is it about?

The brain consists of billions of neurons, which have been of special interest to
neuroscientists due to their ability to communicate with others using electrochemical signals called *spikes*.
They are believed to be the generator of various functions of the brain.
Although there is still no consensus about how the brain encodes information with the spikes,
it is evident that the brain employs temporal information such as spike timing or frequency.

*[Spiking neural network](https://en.wi/kipedia.org/wiki/Spiking_neural_network)* 
has been used to simulate the brain.
SNNs incorporate the concept of *time* into neurons by modeling each neuron 
with time-varying state variables associated with several differential equations.

In this project, I analyzed common primitives of existing neuron models and
designed an ASIC accelerator that can efficiently simulate a wide range of neuron models by 
exploiting those primitives.
The accelerator is highly flexible than the other ASIC accelerators, and also enables
orders-of-magnitude efficient simulation than the general purpose processors.
